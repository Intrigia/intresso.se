# What is Intresso?

Intresso is a social sciences youth magazine for students. We aim to promote further academic education through fun and interesting articles. We also create opportunities for students to write articles in order to further develop their own interest of contribute for other students to get inspired.

## Third time is the charm!
After Daniel Ã–hman created the second design it was time to publish. However, the design was problematic in responsiveness and didn't match with the overall style of the other Intrigia websites. With the feedback from the Intrigia Student Media group he created the version in front of us today. Intresso Kim will follow you on your journey whilst reading all of the interesting articles on the website.
